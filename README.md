## Description
This was created out of necessity to product Node-Maps in the GEXF format for my day-job at [FireScope](https://www.firescope.com). It's a spare-time repository, so any bugs will be addressed as time allows. And I am no expert on GEXF, so the technical support that I can offer is limited. 

## Credits
This library is a ported evolution of [digitalmethodsinitiative/GEXF-library](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/GEXF-library) that looks to be no longer maintained. See also their other tools at https://tools.digitalmethods.net.
